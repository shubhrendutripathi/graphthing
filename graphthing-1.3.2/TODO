This is roughly in order of decreasing priority. If you have a request, send
it to me at <dsymonds@gmail.com>.

	* More output formats:
		- EPS (for LaTeX insertion)
		- GraphBase
		- xfig
		- JPEG/PNG, etc.
	* Editing of adjacency matrix
	* General appearance settings
		- fonts (size, face, etc.)
		- background colour
	* Moving entire graph around page (e.g. w/ Ctrl key)
	* Proper installer for Windows
		- NSIS (http://nsis.sf.net)?
	* Mac port:
		- Old version of bison!
		  (Makes *.tab.cc.h instead of *.tab.hh)
	* Pretty polynomial/matrix displays
	* Accelerators for various things
		- switching modes (space bar: but how to toggle toolbar btns?)
	* "Factorised" forms for chromatic polynomials
	* Help system
	* Quick overview of common statistics
	* Non-integer and negative edge weights
	* Graph layout algorithms
		- internalize some?
			+ spring embedding
		- call out to tools like dot/neato
		- simple zoom-to-fit
	* Digraphs
		- double arcs: (two directed edges between vertex pair)
			+ fix cycling with right-click
			+ fix text attachment positioning
			+ fix spline sizing
		- More network flow stuff
		- Q: in a digraph with an undirected edge, can it be traversed
			twice in an Eulerian cycle?
	* Combinatorial stuff:
		- automorphism group (integration with 'nauty'?)
		- Cycle index polynomial
	* Have undo dialog for multiple simultaneous undos, with descriptions
	* Multigraphs
		- curved edges (4-point bezier curves?)
		- loops
		- need to do a complete code audit!
	* More comprehensive testing
	* Poset stuff:
		- determine if a Hasse diagram
		- spit out minimal ordering
	* Travelling salesman problem (and other standard NP-hard problems)
